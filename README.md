#Data scrapping_Edgar

The script in the repo is used to scrap 10-K data from Edgar. It is not mobile at the moment. Users need to get the script file and change the 10-K location inside the script in order to get 10-K for different companies. At the end of the script, the program will count the number of target words that are repeated.
